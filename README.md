# pyserver
Simple multiclient chat server in python that uses TCP/IP

This chat server is initialised to localhost
If you want to make it so that other people can chat with you, change the HOST variable in client.py to whatever IP addr you are

You must also run the server first

Uses dictionary to keep track of the user and their IP addresses
